After Bran was crowned as the King of the Six Kingdoms, peace had finally returned to Westeros. However, it was not meant to last. A new threat emerged from beyond the Wall, a powerful and mysterious force that threatened to destroy everything that the people of Westeros had fought so hard to protect.

Bran, with his powers as the Three-Eyed Raven, saw the danger that was coming and knew that he had to act. He called upon his council and his allies to prepare for war. Among them was Jon Snow, who had been exiled to the Night’s Watch for killing Daenerys Targaryen.

The armies of the Six Kingdoms marched north to face the enemy. The battle was fierce and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy losses. In the end, it was Jon Snow who made the ultimate sacrifice. He gave his life to defeat the enemy and save Westeros from certain destruction.
