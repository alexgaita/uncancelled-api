Sheldon and Amy are settling into married life and enjoying their Nobel Prize win. But things take a turn when Sheldon’s mother comes to visit. She’s determined to make Sheldon and Amy start a family and won’t take no for an answer.

Sheldon tries to explain to his mother that he and Amy are happy just the way they are, but she won’t listen. In desperation, Sheldon turns to his friends for help. They come up with a plan to convince Sheldon’s mother that they’re not ready for children.

The plan involves a fake baby, a lot of crying, and some very convincing acting from Sheldon and Amy. It all goes off without a hitch until the fake baby starts malfunctioning and making strange noises.

Sheldon’s mother is horrified and starts to back off. But then she turns to Sheldon and says, “Well, I guess you’re not ready for children after all. But don’t worry, there’s always adoption!”

The gang can’t help but laugh as Sheldon’s mother unknowingly delivers the punchline.
